### Program of the Day #1

Write a **math quiz program** that works as follows: it begins by printing an arithmetic problem of your choosing. Then, it prompts the user to enter an answer. Finally, once they have pressed enter, the program prints a message showing the correct answer. *Note*: we don't yet know how to check if the user's answer was correct, but we'll get there soon! A couple sample runs of such a program are shown below; note that the number on the middle line is what's typed by the user before they press enter, while the first and third lines are printed by the program.

```
>>> %Run P01_quiz1.py
What is 4 * 6 ?
24
4 * 6 is 24
```

```
>>> %Run P01_quiz1.py
What is 4 * 6 ?
22
4 * 6 is 24
```

To test your program, make sure your file is named `P01_quiz1.py` and run the `P01_quiz1_test.py` file. For this program, the test file only checks whether your program's output includes `What is`. In future programs, your output will be checked much more thoroughly. If your program passes the test, you should see output that ends with something like the following after running `P01_quiz1_test.py`:

```
P01_quiz1_test.py .                                                      [100%]

============================== 1 passed in 0.05s ===============================
```
