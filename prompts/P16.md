## Program of the Day #16

This program will analyze a tic-tac-toe game whose board is read from a file and determine whether and how a player has won.

The main program reads the game state from the first three lines of a file that represents the game in the following format:

```
x| |x
x|o|o
o| |x
```

Then it prints a message such as the following (for the example input above):

```
After 7 moves, nobody has won.
X| |X
X|O|O
O| |X
```

Here's another example input file, where one player has won:

```
x| |o
x|o|o
o| |x
```

The output for this game is:

```
After 7 moves, player o has won on diagonal 1.
X| |O
X|O|O
O| |X
```

To accomplish this, you will write a number of helper functions, whose behavior is detailed in the functions' specs in the skeleton code. A couple of notes:

* You can assume the input is a valid board state: moves will be either `"x"` or `"o"`, and locations with no moves will be `" "` (a single space). We won't have a board state where both players have 3 in a row).

* If a player has three in a row in multiple places, then the program can describe any one of the winning runs. For example, in the game below, player x has won on the 0th column and the 1st diagonal, so either could be reported.

  ```
  x|o|x
  x|x|o
  x|o|o
  ```

The test cases will check correctness of the helper funtions; there are currently no tests for the main program.

## Other Practice Problems

1. Implement the following function:

   ```python
   def split_address(addr_line):
       """ Split the postal address in address_line into its
       component pieces. Return a tuple of strings containing:
           (number, street, city, state, zip).
       Precondition: the address matches the following format:
           "<number> <street>, <city> <state> <zip>"
       Example: split_address("516 High St, Bellingham WA 98225")
       => ("516", "High St", "Bellingham", "WA", "98225") """
   ```

2. Download [test.txt](code/test.txt). Write a program that counts and prints the number of **unique** lines in the file. Be sure that the text file and your Python program are saved in the same directory.

3. Implement the following function:

   ```python
   def grep(string, filename):
       """ Print all lines of the file filename that contain the given string.
       Precondition: the file exists. """
   ```

5. Implement the following function:

   ```python
   def spellcheck(in_filename, out_filename wordlist):
       """ Write a spellchecked version of in_filename to
       out_filename. For each word in the input file, write
       it as-is to the output file if it is in the wordlist;
       otherwise, write it to the output file in ALLCAPS to
       indicate that it's not in the wordlist. """
   ```
